How to draw something via overlays (<MKOverlay>), renderers and so on: see 1-3 steps in method (-drawCirclesForMeatingPointWithCoordinate:)

life-circle of [direction calculateDirectionsWithCompletionHandler:<#^(MKDirectionsResponse *response, NSError *error)completionHandler#>];

1 - asking for calculation
2 - all row that located after this method
3 - returned results of asking for EVERY request.
3.1 - first we parse and use components of MKDirectionsResponse.
3.2 - when we call [mapView addOverlays] delegate "rendererForOverlay" is invoked first for EVERY id <MKOverlay> of current request-response
3.3 - we go back to the continiue of block (after [mapView addOverlays])
